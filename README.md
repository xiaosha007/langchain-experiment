# LangChain Experiment

This project is an experimental implementation using LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

## Overview

LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, which are sequences of calls to language models and other components. This experiment explores LangChain's capabilities and demonstrates its practical applications.

## Features

- Integration with language models
- Customizable chain components
- Extensible architecture
- [Add your specific features here]

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.13
- Poetry (Python package manager)
- pyenv (Python version manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd langchain-experiment
   ```

2. Install Poetry (package manager):

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

3. Install Python 3.13 using pyenv:

   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.13
   pyenv local 3.13
   ```

4. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   # Or alternatively:
   eval $(poetry env activate)
   ```

## Running in Docker

This project folder includes a Dockerfile that allows you to easily build and host your LangServe app.

### Building the Image

To build the image, you simply:

```shell
docker build . -t my-langserve-app
```

If you tag your image with something other than `my-langserve-app`,
note it for use in the next step.

### Running the Image Locally

To run the image, you'll need to include any environment variables
necessary for your application.

In the below example, we inject the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment
variable with the value set in my local environment
(`$OPENAI_API_KEY`)

We also expose port 8080 with the `-p 8080:8080` option.

```shell
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY -p 8080:8080 my-langserve-app
```
